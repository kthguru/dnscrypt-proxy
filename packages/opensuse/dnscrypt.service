# Description: dnscrypt is a tool that encrypts your DNS queries in order to
#              protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and DNS hijacking
#              (commonly seen in China). It uses OpenDNS resolvers by default.
#              It is BSD-licensed.
#              In openSUSE it's licensed under SuSE-Permissive (non-free ware).
#              For details, refer to its documentation.

# Ntp always has local servers, and there's nothing to encrypt for time.
# and ntp.service isn't native systemd service, if we start before it,
# it will take a long time to sync. just save 20000+ms on boot.
